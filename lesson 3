When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In any situation where you are working from multiple computers or as a group.  Also in cases where the projects are large/important and losing them from the local machine would suck

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That could result in accidentally overwriting or messing up working branches or releasing a new code prematurely.  Manual push/pull gives you control over what is saved and when

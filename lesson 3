When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In any situation where you are working from multiple computers or as a group.  Also in cases where the projects are large/important and losing them from the local machine would suck

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That could result in accidentally overwriting or messing up working branches or releasing a new code prematurely.  Manual push/pull gives you control over what is saved and when

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches exist within a repository and are different code paths
Clones are copies of repositories either from git hub to your local machine or local to local
Forking is similar to cloning, but instead creates a duplicate of the original github repository on your own github account so the original owners work is preserved and they also get credit while you can make your changes

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to work with and track the changes between the remote while working locally/offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be much harder since new versions would have to be created all the time.  Something like google docs could be used to help keep track of things but for the most part it'd  be way more difficult
